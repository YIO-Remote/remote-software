If you'd like to contribute to the YIO documentation, head over to [the documentation repository wiki](https://github.com/YIO-Remote/documentation/wiki) and create issues or pull requests there.

## Submitting pull requests
If you are ready with your code and you know it works, submit a pull request(PR). When submitting a pull request, please follow these guidelines:
- Base all your work off the **develop** branch. The **develop** branch is where active development happens. The master branch is protected and we do not merge pull requests directly into master.
- Name your branch to match the feature/bug fix you are submitting.
- Please keep to one feature or fix per pull request.
- Provide evidence that your code works.
- Make sure your author field is properly filled out with your full name and email address, so we can include you in the credits.

Submitting a pull request is no guarantee it will be accepted, but reviewers will do their best to help move your pull request towards release. Conflicting pull requests will be closed.

## Reviewing pull requests
As a reviewer you need to be familiar with the YIO Remote software architecture and be updated on the latest milestones. You as a reviewer are responsible for only accepting pull requests that are tested.
